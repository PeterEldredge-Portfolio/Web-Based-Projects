# Web-Based-Projects
A collection of projects that can be accessed through my itch.io page. All games were created in Unity.

### Elementary Chess: https://petereldredge.itch.io/elementarychess

This is my most recent completed project. It was also the first time I dabbled with network programming. It is essentially
a chess game with a coat of paint. The game includes all chess rules, as well as quickplay and custom game multiplayer.

I wrote all of the code used in this project, with the exception of Photon 2 (https://doc-api.photonengine.com/en/pun/v2/index.html).
Photon assisted with the multiplayer networking implementaiton, but all gameplay specific code was written solely by me.

This project was an experimental puzzle game, where you control an artifact that can push and pull blocks. The game was in the
early stages when I stopped work on it, but the primary mechanics were implemented. I am really proud of how robust the push/pull 
systems in the game were.

I wrote all of the gameplay code in the project, as well as some editor tools to assist in puzzle creation. I also designed all of the
puzzles in this protoype (although I wish I had more time to flesh them out).

The game is very challenging and difficult to play, partially because I had not perfected the player movement, and partially because of
level design/lack of art assets. You can certainly download the build and give it a try, although if you struggle, there is actually a
complete playthough of the prototype, which does a decent job of showing how robust the mechanics are.

### Surface Tension Walkthrough (First Half): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyKa5FLSJJY

One of my earlier Unity games, and still one of my best. I really wish we had continued to work on this game, and I may even want to go
back and remake it in the future. The game is a puzzle platformer where you can change the properties of certain surfaces. In this
prototype, there were 2 types, bouncy and slick.

I wrote all of the player movement in this game, as well as all of the physics interactions (both from the player and box). This was one of
my earlier games, so the code is not up to the same standards that I have now, but I still think the game was a fun challenge and came out
well! I also designed about 1/3rd of the levels.

If you play the game, keep in mind there may be issues on some browsers. In addition, the tutorials we had set up were not the best. When
playing the game, keep in mind that the 1 and 2 keys change which surface you are placing, and right clicking clears the current surface.
